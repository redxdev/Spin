# See example.seq first!

@begin:load2

+load2
We are now in a new sequence file. The old sequence file has been unloaded to free up memory. This
also means that we can reuse names for pieces of dialogue, though depending on your use case you
may not want to for your own sanity.

In addition to loading a sequence normally, we are also able to specify the specific piece of
dialogue to use in that sequence file just by adding a "next" command.
